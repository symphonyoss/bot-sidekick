Text based on Matt Joyce's instructions:

Python requests module isn't very good at handling p12
certificates. There is however a work around.

How to create a certificate pem file

$ openssl pkcs12 -in bot.user7.p12 -nokeys -out certificate.pem
Enter Import Password: XXXXX
MAC verified OK

Then we export the private key

$ openssl pkcs12 -in bot.user7.p12 -nocerts -out privkey.pem
Enter Import Password: XXXX
MAC verified OK
Enter PEM pass phrase: XXXX
Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase: XXXX

Then we convert to a plainkey

openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out plainkey.pem
