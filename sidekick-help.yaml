intro : |
    Introduction

    Sidekick carries out repetitive tasks in rooms that you share with the bot.

    Tasks for Sidekick include sending out-of-office messages when you are mentioned (sent once a day), send weekly reminders, watching rooms for special words (and receiving those messages in your private Sidekick room), and doing chatroom management and debug actions.

    Being a stateful bot, Sidekick remembers your settings like for example shortcuts for long Sidekick commands. You can also get the list of all rooms that Sidekick observes for you, list your out-of-office messages or the announcements that you scheduled for some future point in time.

    Sidekick is invoked by typing "/sidekick" at the beginning of the line, optionally followed by a command and its parameters. Additional (and shorter) triggers can be defined with the alias command.

    Try it out, start with "/sidekick help".
